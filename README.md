## Introduction

The IT system has revolutionized the field of medicine. In this fast-paced world of medicine, it is a daunting task to manage a multi-specialty hospital. Therefore, My teammates and I took the initiative to build a software for out Institute MNNIT, Allahabad. The MNNIT Health Center Portal is a web-based system that facilitates managing the functioning of the hospital.
Our software automates processes including billing, appointments, scheduling, and medicine inventory management within any healthcare organization. This software helps in making the whole functioning paperless. It integrates all the information regarding patients, doctors, staff, hospital administrative details, etc. into one software. It has dashboards for various professionals that make up a hospital ie. Doctors, Patients, Receptionist, and Pharmacists. It is simple to use, INTUITIVE, INTELLIGENT, and INTEGRATED software for MNNIT's Health Center.
